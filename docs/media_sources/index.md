Media Sources can either be assigned globally via a setting in the Media Source itself, or in an Element's settings by referencing the Media Source ID(s). On install two new settings are added to each Media Source. If you create new Media Sources you will either need to manually add these settings or rerun the installer.

## Media Source Settings

### imageMediaSource
